         <img src="Best-55+-Reading-Books-Wallpaper-on-HipWallpaper-Magical-.jpg">I like to read books like fairy tales and comics. These books help us to improve our knowledgeand develope our reading skills.Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life. Good books can inform you, enlighten you and lead you in the right direction. There is no better companion than a good book. Reading is important because it is good for your overall well-being. Once you start reading, you experience a whole new world. When you start loving the habit of reading you eventually get addicted to it. Reading develops language skills and vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce stress. It is important to read a good book at least for a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning.
